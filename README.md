# BackRNAP-Condensin
Matlab script to simulate the interplay between condensin and RNAP 1D translocation

Developed by Daniel Jost - 2021/02/15

# Description
Experimental evidence indicate that RNAP backtracking may play a key role in positioning condensin in pombe. We formalize this hypothesis in a mathematical model simulating the translocation of condensin across transcribing genes. RNAP elongation is simulated as a TASEP with pauses. Condensin translocation is perturbed by the presence of RNAP with a stronger influence of paused, backtracked, RNAPs. Our results suggest that the inclusion of a sub-population of RNAP with longer dwell-times is essential to fully recapitulate the distribution profiles of condensin around active genes.
